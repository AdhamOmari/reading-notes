  > Best practices for setting your initial monetization strategy
Research other apps in your category: Learn how other developers charge for their apps and content. Consider whether there are benefits to offering users alternative ways to pay.

> Think about how your app will be used: Your app's usage patterns can indicate the best monetization choices. For apps with more casual usage, advertising and in-app purchases might be appropriate options. However, always consider offering an in-app purchase that removes ads.

> Make use of natural extensions: If your app can be extended or expanded, such as with adding levels in a game, consider making the core app available for free and offering extended features through in-app purchases or subscriptions.


> Consider your cost structures: If you have significant recurring content costs, consider using subscriptions. Use a free trial period to encourage uptake.


> Consider your audience: For some audiences, the scope for using advertising, subscriptions, or in-app purchases can be limited. For example, users are more likely to pay for an ad-free, kid-friendly app than a casual use app. In these cases, premium (paid) apps are more appropriate.


> Consider local factors when setting prices: When setting prices for apps, in-app purchases, or subscriptions in specific markets, be sure to consider cost of living differences, local pricing patterns, pricing of competitive apps, and other market factors.
