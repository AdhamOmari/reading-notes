***first of all 
the document object is just one of a set of
objects that all major browsers support.***

*how it work with each other (html,css,js):*

1. html 
  - CONTENT LAYER html files 
  - The HTML gives the page structure and adds semantics. 
2. css
  - PRESENTATION LAYER css files .
  - the HTML content is presented 
  (backgrounds, borders   box dimensions, colors, fonts, etc.).

3. Js 
  - This is where we can change 
   how the page behaves.
  -  adding interactivity.


  It's not just screen sizes that are varied - connection speeds and capabilities of each device can also differ Also, some people browse with JavaScript turned off,so you need to make sure that the page still works for them.  
---------------


 ** by using  html&css& js :
 **You can also reuse the code on several pages(making the site faster to load and easier to maintain)


*** example for using object and method:
 document.write ('heloo');***
we should not do like this :
	~~document + write('heloo);~~ 

 > how to runs js files by using <script> so when the browser comes it load script .

>basic javascript command : 
* STATEMENTS 
* COMMENTS (" /* ")
* VARIABLE we use var ;
 
** we need to know the data types :**
* NUMERIC DATA TYPE 
* STRING DATA TYPE 
* BOOLEAN DATA TYPE
