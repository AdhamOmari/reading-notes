## Text

 > When creating a web page, you add tags 
  (known as markup) to the contents of the 
  page. These tags provide extra meaning 
  and allow browsers to show users the 
   appropriate structure for the page
   ----------------------------

   ### *Headings*
* HTML has six "levels" of headings:

- <h1> is used for main headings
  <h2> is used for subheadings
  If there are further sections 
  under the subheadings then the 
   <h3> element is used, and so 
   on..
------------

---------
### Paragraphs
** To create a paragraph, surround 
the words that make up the 
paragraph with an opening <p>
tag and closing </p> tag **

' * <p>This is a paragraph.</p>* '
' * <p>This is another paragraph.</p>*'
----------------
#### ** Bold & Italic **
** how we use it i code :**
- By enclosing words in the tags <b> and </b> we can make 
characters appear bold.
- By enclosing words in the tags 
<i> and </i> we can make 
characters appear italic.
---------------------
## * Superscript & Subscripit*
** why  we use it i code :**
- The <sup> element is used 
  to contain characters that 
  should be superscript such 
  as the suffixes of dates or 
  mathematical concepts like 
  raising a number to a power such 
  as 22

-The <sub> element is used to 
contain characters that should 
be subscript. It is commonly 
used with foot notes or chemical 
formulas such as H2
0.

--------
### why the browsers not take more than one space :

  > it only displays one space. Similarly if it comes across
  a line break, it treats that as a single space too. This is known as white space collapsing.


 ### Line Breaks & Horizontal Rules 
  ** how to use space then  :**

-* <br />As you have already seen, the browser will automatically show each new paragraph or heading on a new line. But if you wanted to add a line break inside the middle of a paragraph you can use the line break tag <br />*

-* <hr /> 
To create a break between themes — such as a change of topic in a book or a new scene in a play — you can add a 
horizontal rule between sections using the <hr /> tag.*

--------------------

Semantic Markup
===============
## Strong & Emphasis
> why use it :
<strong>The use of the <strong>element indicates that its 
content has strong importance. For example, the words contained in this element might be said with strong emphasis.By default, browsers will show the contents of a <strong>element in bold

>The <em> element indicates 
emphasis that subtly changes 
the meaning of a sentence.
By default browsers will show 
the contents of an <em> element 
in italic.

** Abbreviations & Acronyms **
 ***why to use it and how :***
> <abbr> abbreviations.html HTMLIf you use an abbreviation or an acronym, then the <abbr>element can be used. A titleattribute on the opening tag is used to specify the full term

------------------------

### Author Details
> The <address> element has quite a specific use: to contain 
contact details for the author of the page.It can contain a physical address, but it does not have to. For example, it may also contain a phone number or email address

> ***The key to understanding how CSS works is to imagine that there is an invisible box around every HTML element ***

# CSS
## BLOCK & INLINE ELEMENTS
** Block level elements look like they start on a new line. 
Examples include the <h1>-<h6>, <p> and <div> elements.Inline elements flow within the text and do not start on a new line. Examples include <b>, <i>, <img>, <em> and <span>.**

***why css :***
>CSS allows you to create rules that control the way that each individual box (and the contents of that box) is presented
---------------------------

##### Using External CSS
- <link>
- href
- type
- rel

##### Using Internal CSS
- <style>

# javaScript 
-------- 
> javaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex features on web pages — every time a web page does more than just sit there and display static information for you to look at — displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, 

-------------------

## WHAT IS A VARIABLE? 

>A script will have to temporarily
store the bits of information it
needs to do its job. It can store this
data in variables
