## The key to understanding how CSS works is to imagine that there is an invisible box around every HTML element.


### BLOCK & INLINE ELEMENTS

*** ompared to display: inline, the major difference is that display: inline-block allows to set a width and height on the element.
Also, with display: inline-block, the top and bottom margins/paddings are respected, but with display: inline they are not.
Compared to display: block, the major difference is that display: inline-block does not add a line-break after the element, so the element can sit next to other elements. ***

*-Declarations indicate how 
the elements referred to in 
the selector should be styled. 
Declarations are split into two 
parts (a property and a value), 
and are separated by a colon.*

Three Ways to Insert CSS
There are three ways of inserting a style sheet:
---------------
* External CSS
* Internal CSS
* Inline CSS

#### Foreground Color
1. rgb values
  - These express colors in terms 
of how much red, green and 
blue are used to make it up. For 
example: rgb(100,100,90)

2. hex codes
 * These are six-digit codes that 
represent the amount of red, 
green and blue in a color, 
preceded by a pound or hash # 
sign. For example: #ee3e80

3.  color names
 - There are 147 predefined color 
names that are recognized 
by browsers. For example: 
DarkCyan


** opacity, rgba **
=====
*- CSS3 introduces the opacity
property which allows you to 
specify the opacity of an element 
and any of its child elements. 
The value is a number between 
0.0 and 1.0 (so a value of 0.5
is 50% opacity and 0.15 is 15% 
opacity). *


### HSL Colors

HSL color values are supported in IE9+, Firefox, Chrome, Safari, and in Opera 10+.
HSL stands for hue, saturation, and lightness.
HSL color values are specified with: hsl(hue, saturation, lightness).
