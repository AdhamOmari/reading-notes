## Structure
>The diagram on the right shows 
the directory structure for a 
fictional entertainment listings 
website called ExampleArts. 

# Relationships
>The relationship between 
files and folders on a website 
is described using the same 
terminology as a family tree.

# Homepages
> The main homepage of a site 
written in HTML (and the 
homepages of each section in a 
child folder) is called index.html

--------------------
# Layout

>Building Blocks
* Block-level elements
start on a new line
Examples include:
<'h1> <'p'> <'ul'> <'li'>

* inline elements
flow in between 
surrounding text
Examples include:
<'img> <'b> <'i>
--------------------
#### Containing Elements

>If one block-level element sits inside another 
block-level element then the outer box is 
known as the containing or parent element.
-------------------
# Controlling the Position of Elements

1. position:static
2. position:relative
3. position:absolute
4. position:fixed
5. z-index
6. float
 ---------------------
* Parents of Floated 
Elements: Solution

> Traditionally, developers got 
around this problem by adding 
an extra element after the 
last floated box (inside the 
containing element). A CSS 
rule would be applied to this 
additional element setting the 
clear property to have a value 
of both. But this meant that an 
extra element was added to the 
HTML just to fix the height of the 
containing element.

######Screen Resolution

>Resolution refers to the number of dots a screen shows per inch. Some 
devices have a higher resolution than desktop computers and most 
operating systems allow users to adjust the resolution of their screens .

### Fixed Width Layouts
1. > Advantages
   * Pixel values are accurate 
at controlling size and 
positioning of elements.
● The designer has far greater 
control over the appearance 
and position of items on the 
page than with liquid layouts.
● You can control the lengths 
of lines of text regardless of 
the size of the user's window.
● The size of an image will 
always remain the same 
relative to the rest of the 
page

2. Disadvantages
* You can end up with big gaps 
around the edge of a page.
● If the user's screen is a much 
higher resolution than the 
designer's screen, the page 
can look smaller and text can 
be harder to read.
● If a user increases font sizes, 
text might not fit into the 
allotted spaces.
● The design works best on 
devices that have a site or 
resolution similar to that of 
desktop or laptop computers.
● The page will often take up 
more vertical space than a 
liquid layout with the same 
content
