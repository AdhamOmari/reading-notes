# Layout

```
For a long time, web page authors used <div> elements to group 
together related elements on the page (such as the elements that form a 
header, an article, footer or sidebar). Authors used class or id attributes 
to indicate the role of the <div> element in the structure of the page.

```
----------
*Headers & Footers*
*The `<header>` and`<footer>`elements can be used for:*
1. **The main header or footer 
that appears at the top or 
bottom of every page on the 
site**
1. **A header or footer for an 
individual `<article>` or`<section> `within the page.**

-------------------
##### Navigation
> *The `<nav> `element is used to 
contain the major navigational 
blocks on the site such as the 
primary site navigation.*

-------------------
##### Articles
>**The` <article> `element acts as 
a container for any section of a 
page that could stand alone and 
potentially be syndicated.**
-----------

###### Article
> The `<aside>` element has two 
purposes, depending on whether 
it is inside an `<article>`
element or not

-------------

###### Sections
> *The `<section> `element groups 
related content together, and 
typically each section would 
have its own heading.*

----------------
###### Heading Groups
> **The purpose of the `<hgroup>`
element is to group together a 
set of one or more` <h1>`through 
`<h6>` elements so that they are 
treated as one single heading.**

--------------------

##### Figures
> *You already met the `<figure>`
element in Chapter 5 when we 
looked at images. It can be used 
to contain any content that is 
referenced from the main flow of 
an article (not just images).*

###### Examples of usage include:
1. Images
2. Videos
3. Graphs
4. Diagrams
5.  Code samples
6.   Text that supports the main 
body of an article


-------------------

###### Sectioning Elements
> *It may seem strange to follow 
these new elements by revisiting 
the`<div>` element again. (After 
all, the new elements are often 
going to be used in its place.)*
