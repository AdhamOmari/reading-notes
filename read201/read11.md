# Images
>You can control the size of an 
image using the width and 
height properties in CSS, just 
like you can for any other box. 
>Specifying image sizes helps 
pages to load more smoothly 
because the HTML and CSS 
code will often load before the 
images, and telling the browser 
how much space to leave for an 
image allows it to render the rest 
of the page without waiting for 
the image to download.
You might think that your site 
is likely to have images of all 
different sizes, but a lot of sites 
use the same sized image across 
many of their pages. 
For example, an e-commerce site 
tends to show product photos 
at the same size. Or, if your site 
is designed on a grid, then you 
might have a selection of image 
sizes that are commonly used on 
all pages, such as:
Small portrait: 220 x 360
Small landscape: 330 x 210
Feature photo: 620 x 400
Whenever you use consistently 
sized images across a site, 
you can use CSS to control 
the dimensions of the 
images, instead of putting the 
dimensions in the HTML

> *The background-image
property allows you to place 
an image behind any HTML 
element. This could be the entire 
page or just part of the page. By 
default, a background image will 
repeat to fill the entire box.
The path to the image follows 
the letters url, and it is put 
inside parentheses and quotes*


>This property usually has a pair 
of values. The first represents 
the horizontal position and the 
second represents the vertical.
 1. left top
 2. left center
 3. left bottom
 4. center top
 5. center center
 6. center bottom
 7. right top
 8. right center
 9. right bottom

> Practical Information

> Search engine optimization (or 
SEO) is the practice of trying 
to help your site appear nearer 
the top of search engine results 
when people look for the topics 
that your website covers.
At the heart of SEO is the idea of 
working out which terms people 
are likely to enter into a search 
engine to find your site and then 
using these terms in the right 
places on your site to increase 
the chances that search engines 
will show a link to your site in 
their results.
In order to determine who comes 
first in the search results, search 
engines do not only look at what 
appears on your site. They also 
consider how many sites link 
to you (and how relevant those 
links are). For this reason, SEO 
is often split into two areas: 
on-page techniques and off-page 
techniques.


> On-page techniques are the 
methods you can use on your 
web pages to improve their 
rating in search engines.
The main component of this is 
looking at keywords that people 
are likely to enter into a search 
engine if they wanted to find 
your site, and then including 
these in the text and HTML code 
for your site in order to help the 
search engines know that your 
site covers these topics.
Search engines rely very heavily 
on the text that is in your pages 
so it is important that the terms 
people are going to search for 
are in text. There are seven 
essential places where you want 
your keywords to appear.
Ensuring that any images have 
appropriate text in the value of 
their alt attribute also helps 
search engines understand the 
content of images.
