images help make the difference between an 
average-looking site and a really engaging one.

>If you are building a site from scratch, it is good 
practice to create a folder for all of the images 
the site uses.

### Adding Images

1.  <'img>
> To add an image into the page 
you need to use an <img>
element. This is an empty 
element (which means there is 
no closing tag). It must carry the 
following two attributes

1. src
>This tells the browser where 
it can find the image file. This 
will usually be a relative URL 
pointing to an image on your 
own site. (Here you can see that 
the images are in a child folder 
called images

3. alt
> This provides a text description 
of the image which describes the 
image if you cannot see it.

4. title
> You can also use the title
attribute with the <img> element 
to provide additional information 
about the image. Most browsers 
will display the content of this 
attribute in a tootip when the 
user hovers over the image.

##Height & Width
# height
>This specifies the height of the 
image in pixels

# width
>This specifies the width of the 
image in pixels.
Images often take longer to 
load than the HTML code that 
makes up the rest of the page. 
It is, therefore, a good idea to 
specify the size of the image 
so that the browser can render 
the rest of the text on the page 
while leaving the right amount of 
space for the image that is still 
loading.

# Old Code
>align 
The align attribute was 
commonly used to indicate how 
the other parts of a page should 
flow around an image. It has 
been removed from HTML5 
and new websites should use 
CSS to control the alignment of 
images 


> The align attribute can take 
these horizontal values:
1. left
This aligns the image to the left 
(allowing text to flow around its 
right-hand side).
2. right
This aligns the image to the right 
(allowing text to flow aro

# Aligning Images Vertically
> top
This aligns the first line of the 
surrounding text with the top of 
the image.

>>middle
This aligns the first line of the 
surrounding text with the middle 
of the image.

>>>bottom
This aligns the first line of the 
surrounding text with the bottom 
of the image

# Foreground Color

1. # rgb values
> These express colors in terms 
of how much red, green and 
blue are used to make it up

 2. # hex codes
> These are six-digit codes that 
represent the amount of red, 
green and blue in a color, 
preceded by a pound or hash # 
sign. For example: #ee3e80

3. # color names
> There are 147 predefined color 
names that are recognized 
by browsers. For example: 
DarkCyan

ways of specifying colors on the
